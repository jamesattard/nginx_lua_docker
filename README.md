# Introduction
This is an nginx-lua based simple application based on docker. There is an nginx with lua on the front end, and two postgresql databases setup as master-slave on the backend. This is a private build, not found in DockerHub and author assumes no responsibility. It was part of a technical interview that the author decided to spice it up a bit using Docker.

## Tech
I used the following Docker images:
- Official Centos image (centos7) to build Nginx and compile Lua
- PostgreSQL image (sameersbn/postgresql:9.4-11) to build a master-slave postgresql cluster

I have also used OpenResty (openresty.org) as a web platform that integrates nginx wih lua core and other lua libs.


# Getting started

## Installation

````bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesattard/nginx_lua_docker.git

## Quickstart

Start the containers using:
````bash
docker-compose up -d db_master
docker-compose up -d db_slave
docker-compose up -d app_lua
```

Send a POST request to the app server:
````bash
docker exec -it nginxlua_app_lua_1 curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/post?title=Article1\&body=body1
